## How it works

Using Google Maps, Geolocation and Google Places APIs this app locates your current position and displays on a map all the pubs (user generated) that are around you. Then using a form it filters the pubs following the requirements that yoou input. It also allows you to upland images to your profile and to log in using Github. 


## Built With

Built using HTML5, CSS3, ES6, Node.js.

## Future Features 

In the future I would like to reference users' images taken in a pub and show them on that specific pub's page. Adding a virtual wallet could also be a nice feature.

## Challenges 
Implementing image upload was definitly a difficult thing, the more virtuals you have the more the chances that somethign goes wrong. Other thn that I have had a lot of little issues here and there: typos, missing semi-colons...
